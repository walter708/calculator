### Solution to Coding Test

There are two modules (calc.py and parseData.py)

`parseData` Module is responsible for parsing data coming command line and coverting it into

an array. The `calc` module is resposible for eveluating the parsed expression and printing the solution

There is a file called run.sh which is a bash script that automates tests

There are Six files

                  -> parseData.py which parses incoming data

                  -> calc.py this evaluates the expression

                  -> calc.py is the main file, to execute the
                     program, use the command
                     python calc.py <argument>

                  -> run.sh contain some automated tests that I
                     ran against the solution

                  -> __pycache__ is just a python cache file
                     generated on import operations

                  -> .gitignore which ignores files for git.
